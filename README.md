This is a simple todo app built with HTML, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript. It allows users to create, delete, filter and reorder todo items. The app also supports dark/light mode toggling and stores todo items in the local storage.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (CSS preprocessor)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vannila Javascript



### What I learned
- Array Manipulation: Learned how to manipulate arrays to add, filter, delete and reorder todo items.
- Event listeners: Gained experience in adding event listeners to DOM elements for user interaction.
- DOM manipulation: Learned how to dynamically update the DOM to reflect changes made by users.
- Local storage: Explored the use of local storage to persist data between sessions.

### Continued development
Going forward I will improve the way I handle arrays, the efficiency of my code and optimize for better performance.

### Useful resources

- [The Coder Coder](https://youtu.be/_oP3IHzVZ8I?si=TclKyZQxT4wC9i8L) - This helped me learn to toggle between light mode and dark mode. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://youtu.be/jfYWwQrtzzY?si=muGVMmAXjLannQ90) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to drag and drop elements using javascript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
